RubyLoginComponent is an authentication component for Rails based on Devise.

You can find more about how Devise work by taking a look on the [wiki](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)

## Starting with Rails?
If you are building your first Rails application, we recommend you do not use Devise. Devise requires a good understanding of the Rails Framework. In such cases, we advise you to start a simple authentication system from scratch. Today, we have three resources that should help you get started:

Michael Hartl's online book: https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users
Ryan Bates' Railscast: http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch
Codecademy's Ruby on Rails: Authentication and Authorization: http://www.codecademy.com/en/learn/rails-auth
Once you have solidified your understanding of Rails and authentication mechanisms, we assure you Devise will be very pleasant to work with. ðŸ˜ƒ
